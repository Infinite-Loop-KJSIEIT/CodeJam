We try to maximize the total percentage 
Program steps 
1. sort the input array a[] in descending order with: 
 remain value, which is the decimal value if a[i]*100/N 
 N being the total number of people 
2. Skip all the languages which have more that “0.5” value in the remain 
 Ex: these languages will be rounded off to the next integer, and it takes more votes to change its value such that it’s 
     rounded off to the next integer 
3. Add votes to languages which have less than “0.5” value in the remain until it is >=.05 
 note: as the array is sorted, we first vote languages which require less votes so that the percentage is rounded off to the 
  next integer 
4. vote for new languages if there are still people left to vote after traversing the array 
 Ex: it takes fewer votes to make the percentage change of a new language than voting for existing language 
  whose remain value is more that “0.5”
