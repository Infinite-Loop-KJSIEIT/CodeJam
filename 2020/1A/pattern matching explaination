Explaination:
See the example below:

test case 1:
when string starts and ends with *

eg
*abc*
*h*g*
*e*fi*

Ans:
abchgefi
all in between elements are added here in between

test case 2:
when there exists a preffix and suffix:

ab*c*
*h*g*i
*e*fi
a*hko*
abr*

Ans:
abr   c h g h k o   fi 
   
longest prefix is abr and the longest suffix is fi
we attached that in the string first from ahead and from behind

the remaining characters are added in between in line

if there is no matching suffix or prfix in between return *
ab*c*
z*h*g*i
*e*fi
a*hko*y
abr*

Ans:
*
